Web3 Install Issues on Windows
Section 2, Lecture 37

In the next video we're going to install a couple of modules using NPM.  

If you are using Windows, you need to install additional dependencies right now (before continuing to the next video).  If you are running OSX or a Linux-based OS, skip this and continue on.

If you already attempted to install web3 and get errors about Visual Studio C++ tools not being installed or MSBuild errors then the following steps should help you.


Option #1:

Open up your terminal as administrator and run the following command:

npm install --global --production windows-build-tools 


Option #2

Many students have noted that Option #1 fails and no longer works. If you find this to be true, then you will need to install the Visual Studio C++ build tools manually: https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#option-2


If you still have issues installing then I recommend checking out this post here (https://www.udemy.com/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/learn/v4/questions/3613606) for some additional troubleshooting tips. (Please remember, that since this post is older, the versions may not be the same) I do encourage you to create a new post instead of adding a question to that post as it is now very long.
